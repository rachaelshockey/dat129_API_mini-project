    "In the U.S. philanthropic realm, there is a well-known tax rule applied to foundations known as the \"Five Percent Payout Rule.\" [The Council on Foundations describes offers the following definition](https://www.ncfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/The-Five-Percent-Minimum-Payout-Requirement-COF-2000-the-five-percent-minimum-payout-requirement.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Each year every private foundation must make eligible charitable expenditures that equal or exceed approximately 5\n",
    "> percent of the value of its endowment. The word \"payout\" while convenient is somewhat misleading and is not used in the   > Tax Code section that creates the rule. The word \"payout\" suggests grants or contributions paid out to other charities.  > Although these grants normally make up more than 93 percent of the expenditures of most foundations, many other expenses  > can also qualify in meeting the minimum payout requirement. In short, the 5 percent payout rule need not be satisfied\n",
    "> solely with grants.\n",

    "The program below uses an [API from Guidestar](https://apiportal.guidestar.org/api-static-documentation-v2)--a free charity watchdog service that is widely used by funders and charities alike--to parse a given foundation's tax forms (Form 990) to determine what percentage of a foundation's assets was donated to charity in their most recently reported tax year. \n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in the quote above, because a foundation's total expenses reported on their tax forms may include non-charitable expenses (i.e. their own operating costs can count toward the 5% payout), we have to dig a little deeper in the 990 to find the actual amount paid out to charities. A form 990 can be a very dense document to sift through. The Guidestar API makes it much easier to find specific indicators of a charity's financial practices and overall health. To search for a specific charity, the only piece of information you need to provide is the organization's IRS-issued employer identification number, known as an EIN. "

    "The people who run the first five foundations listed below have signed [The Giving Pledge](https://givingpledge.org/About.aspx), an initiative launched 11 years ago by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett urging fellow billionaires to make a public commitment  to give away a majority of their personal fortunes within their lifetimes. This is not a new idea: In 1889, philanthropist Andrew Carnegie wrote \"The Gospel of Wealth,\" which called for those with exceptional resources to give away the majority of their wealth, during their lifetimes, to support community needs. Working in fundraising, I often wonder about the extent to which charitable foundations serve this goal, and whether or not they should. \n"
